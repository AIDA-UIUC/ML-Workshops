# Neural Networks

A bare-bones introduction to neural networks through a classic problem. What will be covered:
1. The XOR problem
2. Neural network basics (activation & loss functions, forward pass)
3. Neural network training (backpropogation algorithm + SGD)
4. Visualising what the neural network has "learned"

## Usage
