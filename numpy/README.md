# NumPy and Tensors
An intermediate introduction to NumPy and mutlidimensional arrays (tensors). This is an important topic because many numerical computing/linear algebra libraries have a similar style and functionality as NumPy. What will be covered:
1. Introduction to mulitdimensional arrays
2. Indexing
3. Vectorization
4. Random sampling

## Usage
Clone the repo and make sure to have all the necessary packages installed by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
Then simply run `jupyter-notebook numpy.ipynb`!
