# The XOR Problem

A bare-bones introduction to neural networks through a classic problem. What will be covered:
1. Neural network basics (activation & loss functions, forward pass)
2. Neural network training (backpropogation algorithm + SGD)
3. Visualising what the neural network has "learned"

## Usage
